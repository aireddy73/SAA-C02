# Cloud-Computing-Fundamentals

Cloud computing provides

On-Demand Self-Service: Provision and terminate using a UI/CLI without human interaction.
Broad Network Access: Access services over any networks on any devices using standard protocols and methods.
Resource Pooling: Economies of scale, cheaper service.
Rapid Elasticity: Scale up and down automatically in response to system load.
Measured Service: Usage is measured. Pay only for what you consume.
# Public vs Private vs Multi Cloud
Public Cloud: using 1 public cloud such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
Private Cloud: using on-premises real cloud. Must meet 5 requirements.
Multi-Cloud: using more than 1 public cloud in one deployment.
Hybrid Cloud: using public and private clouds in one environment
This is NOT using Public Cloud and Legacy on-premises hardware.
